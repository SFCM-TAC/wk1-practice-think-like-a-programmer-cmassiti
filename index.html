    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.

      instrument - Guitar
      Objects - String, Fret, Body.
      <br>Properties - Pitch, Timbre, Dynamics, Duration, Tempo.
      <br>Events - Pluck, Pick, Strum, Slide, Hammer-On/Off, Tap.
